In this homework we tried a fun experiment, creating an EMF reader.

I used a 7 segment display to display the value we detect
a shift register to control it all
a button to turn it on off
a speaker that beeps slower/faster depending on the reading
a servomotor that serves to give us a visual representation of the levels we are reading.

This is a simple device capable of detection electromagnetic fields using a plain sensor, in this case a piece of bare wire
