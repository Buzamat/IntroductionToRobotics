In this homework i used a joystick to set the values in a 4-digit7-segment display connected to a shift register 74hc595. 
I used interrupts, and saved the last value, state and digit selected in eeprom and load it when starting the arduino.

Components:
Joystick
4  digit  7-segment  display
74hc595  shiftregister

First  state: 
I use the x axis on the joystick to cycle through 4 digits  a  joystick  axis  to  cycle  through  the  4digits; using the other axis does nothing. 
A blinking decimal point shows the current digit position. 
When pressing the button (i use interrupt), i lock  in  on  the  selected  digit and enter thesecond state.  
Second state:
The decimal point stays always on, no longerblinking and you can no longer use the axis to cycle through the 4 digits.
Instead, using the other axis, you can increment on decrement the numberon the current digit.
Pressing the button again returns you to the previousstate.
Also, each joystick push increases/decreases one unit, it doesn't continuously increment if you keep the joystick in one position.
